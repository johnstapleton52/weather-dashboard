Hello,
I know that this assignment is not complete. I apologize for that, but I fell behind on work in the previous weeks and will lack the knowledge necessary to fill in the gaps until I manage to get caught up. I plan to resubmit a better version once I'm caught up.
I spent hours trying to set up the search history in the local storage and wasn't able to figure that one out. I also did not see a parameter for UV indexing on the API calls I tried from openweathermap. I also was unable to figure out how to utilize data that returns as a string from an API call (primary example is the dates resulting as undefined on the forecasts).
I know that's quite a few things to not get right about the assignment and I apologize. I may need some help getting caught up, so I'll have to keep in touch with you guys. For now, though, this was the best I was able to do.

Thank you
